NAME
    CPAN::Nargile - Front-end for cpansmoke

SYNOPSIS
     nargile.pl --cpan http://www.cpan.org --ask

     or if you want to run it on another perl installation:
 
     nargile.pl --cpan http://www.cpan.org --perl /home/gabor/perl/585/bin/perl -ask

     See also nargile.pl --help

DESCRIPTION
     Enable the user on any platform (will someone test this on other platforms as well, please)
     to run smoke tests of CPAN modules.

     The original recommended CPAN smoking is done based on e-mails sent to the 
     CPAN Testsers mailing list. This has the drawback that it requres some way to 
     parse the incoming mails on the same box where I want to run the smoker.
 
     Nargile downloads the list of the latest modules from CPAN and works on that list so
     you don't need to read mail any more.

     It also ensures that only modules that already reached CPAN will be tested.

  Frequency
     By default CPANPLUS is being configured to reload its index ever 86400 seconds,
     that is 24 hours. If you would like to run nargile more often with fresh data
     from CPAN you'll have to configure the C<update> value of CPANPLUS to a lower number.

FILES
     The scipt maintains a file called $ENV{HOME}/.nargile.dbm where it lists the
     distributes which were already tried.

BUGS
     This is an experimental version that works on my computer...

     Sometimes I get the following error message:
 
     Can't call method "module" on an undefined value at /home/gabor/perl/585/lib/site_perl/5.8.5/CPANPLUS/Internals/Install.pm line 220.

     It seems that cpansmoke when it notices that I have already sent a report about a distribution
     (in a previous life) it won't even install it. This might be a problem but it might be that it
     happens only as I have installed some modules in a previous attemt to test the Nargile script.

     This might be a bug in CPANPLUS 0.049 -  should upgrade it before complaining:
     In the recent uploads list there was 
     TMTM      Text-Decorator-1.5.tar.gz 

     but when I ran cpansmok Text-Decorator-1.5
     it tiread to fetch  /S/SI/SIMON/Text-Decorator-1.5.tar.gz
     It seem the module just changed owners as SIMON has the earlier versions of this module.

TODO
     Fix the bugs.

     Enable the user to give a list of modules (using regexes) to be smoked or a list of 
     modules (using regexes) to exclude from smoking.

     Enable the user to decide per module if s/he wants to smoke it or not.

     Interactive mode asking the user for every module what to do before and maybe even after running it.
     Test/Skip/Quit/Exclude ?

     Reduce prerequisites of this module ?

     Enable user initiate smoking a specific distribution by giving its name.

     Automatically skip Bundles ?
 
     With the current way of testing all the files in the latest 150 it migth happen that
     the user uploaded 2 or more versions in the past few days and we might test an already
     outdated version (in addition to the new one). Worse than that it can easily happen
     especially if using CPAN::Mini that we don't have one of the versions. I should find out
     first what is really the latest version of a dist on the CPAN mirror I am using.

     Somehow catch the output of each cpansmoke run (using script on unix ?) for later reference.

Changes
  v0.03
     code moved mostly from script to module

     fix bug
       When user selects Skiping a module or Quiting (in case of --ask) the name of the module is already
       addedd to the "smoked" list and it won't be smoked again in the next run.
     split the Don't do and the Skip modes

     cpanplus option -p removed to install prerequisites too

Spelling
     Maybe it was better if I spelled it as Nargila ?
